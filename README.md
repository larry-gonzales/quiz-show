# quiz-show
A responsive, multiple-choice quiz app built with pure HTML, CSS and JS.

The quiz app features four categories: Movies, Sports, Cartoons and Music.

The initial layout and graphics were designed in Photoshop and Illustrator. The focus of this project was to write and understand the JavaScript portion of the code. The process lead me to push my knowledge as far as possible before looking for answers. 

Ultimately, this project helped reinforce my comprehension on how to manipulate elements in JavaScript.
